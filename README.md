FEATURE-EXTRACTION-OF-PRODUCT-REVIEWS-
======================================
The aim of this project is to make an application in the field of natural language 
processing in order to find and implement a novel algorithm to solve the problem of 
measuring real-time comments made by users on products. For this we have collected the 
reviews from various websites like twitter, blogs that are been written by different users 
about a particular product and then the polarity of the each feature of the mentioned 
product is determined that either it is negative, positive and neutral. For determining the 
polarity of the feature of product, the sentiment of feature word (noun) of the text is 
calculated and corresponding scores are given to public opinions of the productâ€™s feature 
which could being used to compare between the product based on a particular feature and 
a statistical output was produced to show the results. The methods used in this project 
can be used for any specific product with public opinions.
